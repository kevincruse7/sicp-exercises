# Exercise 2.15

Yes, Eva is correct. As exercise 2.13 showed, each operation between intervals with non-zero tolerances compounds the resultant tolerance. By expressing interval expressions with unnecessary repetitions of intervals with non-zero tolerances, you "double count" the uncertainty of the interval. Therefore, `par2` is more correct due to its lack of double counting.

# Exercise 1.15

```scm
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine (/ 12.15 3.0)))
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine (/ 4.05 3.0))))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine (/ 1.35 3.0)))))
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine (/ 0.45 3.0))))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine (/ 0.15 3.0)))))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
```

For `(sine 12.15)`, `p` is applied five times.

The space complexity of `sine` with respect to `angle` ($n$) can be expressed with the following recurrence relation:

```math
\begin{align*}

S(n) &= \Theta(1) + S \left( \frac{n}{3} \right) \\[2ex]

&= \Theta(\log n)

\end{align*}
```

The time complexity of `sine` with respect to `angle` ($n$) can be expressed with the following recurrence relation:

```math
\begin{align*}

T(n) &= \Theta(1) + T \left( \frac{n}{3} \right) \\[2ex]

&= \Theta(\log n)

\end{align*}
```
